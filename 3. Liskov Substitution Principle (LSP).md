3. # **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) in Detail with C# Example**

---

## **Understanding the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**

### **Definition:**
The **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)** states:  

> **‚ÄúSubtypes must be substitutable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.‚Äù**  

In simpler terms, if class **B** is a subclass of class **A**, we should be able to replace **A** with **B** without breaking the functionality.

### **Why is LSP Important?**
- Ensures that derived classes extend base classes without unexpected behavior.
- Prevents code from breaking when using polymorphism.
- Helps in designing a robust and maintainable object-oriented system.

## **Real-World Analogy: Bird & Ostrich Problem üê¶**
Imagine we have a **Bird** class with a method `Fly()`. We create a `Sparrow` class that can fly, so everything works fine.  

Now, we create an `Ostrich` class, which is also a bird **but cannot fly**. If we override `Fly()` and throw an exception, any code expecting a `Bird` might break.  

Thus, `Ostrich` violates LSP because it does not behave like a proper subtype of `Bird`.

---

## **Example 1: Violating LSP in C# (Bad Design)**
Here‚Äôs a **wrong** way to design the Bird class:

```csharp
public class Bird  
{  
    public virtual void Fly()  
    {  
        Console.WriteLine("This bird is flying.");  
    }  
}  

public class Sparrow : Bird  
{  
    // Sparrow can fly, so no problem here.
}  

public class Ostrich : Bird  
{  
    // Ostrich cannot fly! Violating LSP
    public override void Fly()  
    {  
        throw new NotImplementedException("Ostrich cannot fly!");  
    }  
}  

class Program  
{  
    static void Main()  
    {  
        Bird bird1 = new Sparrow();  
        bird1.Fly();  // Works fine ‚úÖ  

        Bird bird2 = new Ostrich();  
        bird2.Fly();  // ‚ùå Throws an exception (Breaking LSP)  
    }  
}
```

### **Problems in the Above Code**
üö® **Unexpected Exceptions**: If a program expects all `Bird` objects to fly, an exception will break it.  
üö® **Incorrect Inheritance**: `Ostrich` is a `Bird`, but it doesn‚Äôt fully behave like one.  
üö® **Violates Substitution**: You cannot replace `Bird` with `Ostrich` safely.

---

## **Example 2: Correcting LSP (Better Design)**
To fix this, we should separate **flying birds** from **non-flying birds**.

### **Solution: Use Interfaces to Separate Behaviors**
```csharp
// Base class for all birds
public abstract class Bird  
{  
    public abstract void Eat();  
}  

// Interface for flying birds
public interface IFlyable  
{  
    void Fly();  
}  

// Sparrow is a bird that can fly
public class Sparrow : Bird, IFlyable  
{  
    public override void Eat()  
    {  
        Console.WriteLine("Sparrow is eating.");  
    }  

    public void Fly()  
    {  
        Console.WriteLine("Sparrow is flying.");  
    }  
}  

// Ostrich is a bird, but it does NOT implement IFlyable
public class Ostrich : Bird  
{  
    public override void Eat()  
    {  
        Console.WriteLine("Ostrich is eating.");  
    }  
}  

class Program  
{  
    static void Main()  
    {  
        Bird sparrow = new Sparrow();  
        sparrow.Eat();  

        IFlyable flyingBird = new Sparrow();  
        flyingBird.Fly();  // Works fine ‚úÖ  

        Bird ostrich = new Ostrich();  
        ostrich.Eat();  // Works fine ‚úÖ  

        // Ostrich does not implement IFlyable, so we cannot call Fly() on it
    }  
}
```

---

## **Key Improvements in the Fixed Code**
‚úÖ **No Unexpected Exceptions**: `Ostrich` does not have a `Fly()` method, so it cannot break the program.  
‚úÖ **Properly Organized Code**: `IFlyable` interface ensures only birds that can fly implement `Fly()`.  
‚úÖ **LSP is Followed**: We can substitute any `Bird` without breaking functionality.  

---

## **Conclusion**
- **Bad Design:** Forcing all birds to implement `Fly()` leads to violations of LSP.  
- **Good Design:** Use an **interface (IFlyable)** for birds that can fly.  
- **Key Learning:** Always ensure that a derived class **fully** follows the behavior of its base class.  

By following **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**, we ensure a **flexible, maintainable, and error-free** object-oriented design. üöÄ
